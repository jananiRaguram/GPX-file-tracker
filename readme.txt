Final Project for CIS2750. 
This project was developed to build front end and backend knowledge of javascript with C and some SQL on the database side. 

The final result is a web app where the user can upload GPX files and see details of the GPX files that are normally not easy to read. 


Detials for running the program: 

After uploading a file the user needs to login to database.

Since rename and add route functionality needs the database you won't be able to use them unless you're logged in.

If a new file is created or added and you rename a route or add a route before storing it on the database, the changes will only show in the database once you press "store files".
